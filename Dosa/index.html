                <ol type="I">
                    <li>Rinse the rice and urad dal separately in water. Soak them along with fenugreek seeds in enough water for at least 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
                    <li>Drain the soaked rice and urad dal. Grind them separately to a smooth batter using a wet grinder or blender, adding water as needed.</li>
                    <li>Combine both batters in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well. Cover and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or until the batter doubles in size.</li>
                    <li>Once fermented, stir the batter gently. Heat a non-stick skillet or tawa over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil.</li>
                    <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the skillet and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin dosa.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle some oil around the edges and cook until the dosa turns golden brown and crispy. Flip if desired and cook for another minute.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the skillet and serve hot with chutney and sambar.</li>
                </ol>
